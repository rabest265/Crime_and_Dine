## Project Title
* Crime and Dine

## Team Members
* Rachel Berkowitz, Jeanette Cross, Michael Lygas, Xeniya Bogoslavskaya

## Project Description/Outline
* Comparing the restaurant ratings to the US crime statistics and income.

## Research Description/Outline
* Look at the different rates for different crimes (murder, bugglery etc.) compared to the restaurant ratings and income.

## Research Question to Answer
* Does the number of high rated restaurants in a given area correlate to the  number of crimes in the area?
* How does it differ by different types of crimes?
* How does avg household income affect the restaurant rating?
* How does it affect the crime rate?

## Data Sets to be Used
* Restaurant rating data (from csv by lat, long)
* Crime data from United States crime rates by county
* Income data from the census
* govt api that converts lat and long to county

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
* Import and pull all data
* Transform it into datasets etc.
* Clean the data for errors
* Compile the data to be at the same level (county perhaps)
* Merge the three datasets together
* Graphing and mapping the dataset to answer our questions

## Hypothesis
* We expect there not to be a corrrelation between the restaurant ratings and the crime statistics because their are oftern good eateries in bad areas. We expect more expensive restaurants to get a higher rating but that income will not be correlated.
